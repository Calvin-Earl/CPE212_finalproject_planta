                <p>
                    This course taught more about the Linux environment, especially about server management and 
                    automation using Ansible. I learned a lot about ansible's fundamentals, such as the packages 
                    and prerequisites to be installed in order for ansible to run smoothly, the servers and 
                    manage nodes with appropriate ssh configurations, and the essential files to create 
                    (configuration and inventory file) for ansible automation. In addition to that, I also learned 
                    about containerization technology using a tool called Docker, which is a powerful technology 
                    that allows administrators to isolate applications and deploy webapps, software applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the start of this course, I was introduced to server management by creating a workstation 
                    and Server node setup, which required running multiple virtual machines at once. After completing 
                    the ssh setup and configuration for all nodes, I had a clear idea of how companies and corporations 
                    manage their servers. I then proceeded to learn how to use Ansible, and as the course progressed, 
                    I learned more techniques in using Ansible, such as using variables from configuration file inputs, 
                    playbook consolidation, and applying roles. I also learned how to use Docker to containerize 
                    applications, allowing us to use the contained app without worrying about dependencies. I also 
                    learned that Docker can be used to deploy web applications, and by combining containerization and 
                    automation, I realized that this is one method that successful corporations, like Netflix and IBM, 
                    use to operate to deploy their services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Overall, this course taught me valuable skills in system administration, automation, and 
                    containerization within the Linux environment. By mastering tools like Ansible and Docker, I 
                    gained practical experience in managing and deploying systems efficiently. This knowledge equips 
                    me with in-demand skills that may open many job opportunities in areas like DevOps, cloud 
                    computing, and IT infrastructure management in the future.
